# Design brief
Project name: Bicycle library

## Company description
Bicycle Innovation Lab is a Danish voluntary association (forening) and incubator of bicycle related projects. One of the projects they currently run is a bicycle library where users can loan and try bikes to figure out which one to buy.

## Target audience
Anyone who wants to test out a bike and getting an idea on how it is to live day-to-day with a bike. Some of their reasons to try out a bike can be for fitness, leisure, an easy and stress-free way to get to work or moving something. With bikes being expensive and having lots of options it can be hard to choose and an expensive lesson. The typical user would be between 20-50 years old and needs to be or become a member of the association and sign up for a 1-3 month before they can loan bikes.

Another audience is companies who want to run a loan-a-bike scheme. Borrowing bikes from Bicycle Innovation Lab to lend out to their employees getting them to bike more to work.

## Pros and cons with current system
The current system supports loaning out bikes, and users booking bikes for pickup, and that is about it. Everything within the lab is managed with a single WordPress site running a customized woo commerce plugin. It is currently hard to maintain and offers little flexibility. 

## Wishes for the new system
Bicycle innovation lab would like a system, which makes it easier to administrate a bike fleet. The system should give an overview of its resources. The overview could be of the status of each bike. With sections for bikes that will be loaned out shortly and bikes, which will be coming back to the library soon. Possible to see how many users have joined in a given timeframe. In addition, show number of bikes, which was loaned out in a given timeframe. 

Make it possible to loan out bikes to other business. Therefore, that business can use those bikes to loan out for their employees. 

Members of the bicycle library or employees in a business library should be able to use a simple app that gives them an engaging presentation of all the bikes. the process from browsing and booking a bike should be as fast and engaging as possible, so the users spends less time placing a booking and more time on a bike.
The admins also should be able to make project and to have members of the association(forening) be able to reserve/sign up for those projects.

Generally the system should be *fast*, *user friendly*, *engaging* and have good *SEO*
